## Puppeteer with Browserbase
A web browser for your AI. Browserbase is the developer platform to reliably run, manage, and monitor headless browsers.

Get complete control over browsers and leverage Browserbase's
[Infrastructure](https://docs.browserbase.com/under-the-hood), [Stealth Mode](https://docs.browserbase.com/features/stealth-mode), and
[Session Debugger](https://docs.browserbase.com/features/sessions) to power your automation, test suites,
and LLM data retrievals.

**Get started in under one minute** with Puppeteer.

## Features
- **Multi-turn Browser Automation**: The application now supports multi-turn browser automation, allowing you to send a sequence of commands to the same browser session.
- **Persistent Sessions**: The application now uses persistent sessions, which remain active between commands, allowing for complex, multi-step workflows.
- **Real-time Debugging**: A live view of the browser is streamed to the frontend, allowing you to see the agent's actions in real-time.
- **Session Management**: The application includes basic session management features, allowing you to create, list, get, and end Browserbase sessions.
- **Command Execution**: You can send commands to the agent, which will be executed in the browser.
- **Data Extraction**: The application includes an example of how to use the agent to extract data from a webpage.
